# calculator

First project. It took me more than half a month to complete this(Im a newb, don't hate).
Yeah, my design sucks. :D
But that hover and keyboard support tho.

I made a ton of validations(This took the most time and the damn keyboard support). If you find a bug, let me know.
Plus I did all the extra credits(okay maybe not the `Make it look great`-part, it functions great tho).
